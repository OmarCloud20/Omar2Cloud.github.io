      <description>What is Raspberry Pi (RPI)? The Raspberry Pi is a small single-board computer capable of doing almost everything that an ordinary Linux-based computer can do. Once it connects to an HDMI display, a keyboard, and a mouse, we have have a fully functional computer for a pice of $35 (or even way less for the Raspberry Pi Zero). The Raspberry Pi is widely known and used for home lab environments, where anyone can experiment safely.</description>

      <description>What is a Virtual Network Computing (VNC)? VNC is a graphical desktop sharing system that allows you to remotely control the desktop interface from another computer or mobile device (running VNC Viewer). VNC Viewer transmits the keyboard and the mouse events to VNC Server, and receives updates to the screen in return. Setting up a VNC Server on our RPI 4 is very beneficial to gain access to it from another device.</description>

      <description>What is a X11VNC Server? The Virtual Network Computing (VNC) allows to view and interact with devices remotely with any VNC viewer. When working with multiple RPIs, having VNC servers give us access all our RPIs from one device. There are many VNC servers and X11VNC is one of them. On another tutorial, we will install RealVNC, which is another vnc server. I will go over why do we need to install X11VNC on Ubuntu and RealVNC on RPI OS.</description>

      <description>Updating the Operating System Now, we have a secured connection with our instance, let&amp;rsquo;s update and upgrade the operating system. Updating and upgrading the operating system of the instance is always a good habit to have. We will run the following update/upgrade commands. The -y in the end of the command line will automatically enters &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; as a confirmation before installing the updates.
sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt upgrade -yCleaning up after an update If this is not the packages first time to run an update, there might have some unnecessary packages left for cleaning.</description>

      <description>Resetting Admin password in Portainer running as container Portainer does not have a password reset feature. We will have to you use a password container helper.
1- Firstly, we will stop the Portainer container.
docker container stop portainer2- We will run the helper using the same bind-mount/volume for the data volume
docker run --rm -v portainer_data:/data portainer/helper-reset-passwordThe response should be similar to the below.
2020/06/04 00:13:58 Password succesfully updated for user: admin2020/06/04 00:13:58 Use the following password to login: &amp;amp;_4#\3^5V8vLTd)E&amp;quot;NWiJBs26G*9HPl13- Finally, we will restart the Portainer container.</description>
