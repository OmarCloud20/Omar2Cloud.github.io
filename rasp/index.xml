      <description>What is Raspberry Pi (RPI)? The Raspberry Pi is a small single-board computer capable of doing almost everything that an ordinary Linux-based computer can do. Once it connects to an HDMI display, a keyboard, and a mouse, we have have a fully functional computer for a pice of $35 (or even way less for the Raspberry Pi Zero). The Raspberry Pi is widely known and used for home lab environments, where anyone can experiment safely.</description>

      <description>What is a X11VNC Server? The Virtual Network Computing (VNC) allows to view and interact with devices remotely with any VNC viewer. When working with multiple RPIs, having VNC servers give us access all our RPIs from one device. There are many VNC servers and X11VNC is one of them. On another tutorial, we will install RealVNC, which is another vnc server. I will go over why do we need to install X11VNC on Ubuntu and RealVNC on RPI OS.</description>
